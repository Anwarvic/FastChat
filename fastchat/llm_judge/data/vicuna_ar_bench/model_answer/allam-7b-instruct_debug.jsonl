Let's break it down step by step:\n1. First, we'll simplify the right side of the equation by distributing the 5:\n5(x - 2) = 5x - 10\n2. Now, we'll subtract 10 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x on the left side:\n3x + 10 - 10 = 5x - 10 - 10\n3. This simplifies to:\n3x = 5x - 20\n4. Next, we'll subtract 5x from both sides of the equation to get x by itself on the left side:\n3x - 5x = -20\n5. This simplifies to:\n-2x = -20\n6. Finally, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -2 to solve for x:\nx = -20 / -2\nx = 10\nSo the solution to the equation 3x + 10 = 5(x - 2) is x = 10."]}], "tstamp": 1756195550.9131567}
